# CreditCardFraud
## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, applying machine learning models to predict fraud, and visualizing the results. The analysis and modeling are conducted in a Google Collab (.ipynb file).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available credit card transactions dataset, which contains both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The dataset includes features such as transaction amount, time, and various anonymized features.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
In this section, we explore the dataset to understand its structure, detect any anomalies, and identify key patterns. The EDA includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Distribution of transaction amounts
Correlation analysis between features
Analyzing the class imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions
Modeling
We apply various machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting
The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Visualization
Visualization plays a key role in understanding the data and interpreting the results. The project includes the following visualizations:

Distribution plots for transaction amounts
Correlation heatmaps
ROC curves for model comparison
Confusion matrices to visualize model performance
